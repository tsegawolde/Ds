A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load adjusting is the approach to conveying load units (i.e., occupations/assignments) across the organization which is associated with the distributed system. Load adjusting should be possible by the load balancer. The load balancer is a framework that can deal with the load and is utilized to disperse the assignments to the servers. The load balancers allocate the primary undertaking to the main server and the second assignment to the second server.
 
Purpose of Load Balancing in Distributed Systems:
•	Security: A load balancer provide safety to your site with practically no progressions to your application.
•	Protect applications from emerging threats: The Web Application Firewall (WAF) in the load balancer shields your site.
•	Authenticate User Access: The load balancer can demand a username and secret key prior to conceding admittance to your site to safeguard against unapproved access.
•	Protect against DDoS attacks: The load balancer can distinguish and drop conveyed refusal of administration (DDoS) traffic before it gets to your site.
•	Performance: Load balancers can decrease the load on your web servers and advance traffic for a superior client experience.
•	SSL Offload: Protecting traffic with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) on the load balancer eliminates the upward from web servers bringing about additional assets being accessible for your web application.
•	Traffic Compression: A load balancer can pack site traffic giving your clients a vastly improved encounter with your site.

Load Balancing Approaches:
•	Round Robin 
•	Least Connections 
•	Least Time 
•	Hash 
•	IP Hash 
Classes of Load Adjusting Calculations:
Following are a portion of the various classes of the load adjusting calculations.
•	Static: In this model assuming any hub/node is found with a heavy load, an assignment can be taken arbitrarily and move the undertaking to some other arbitrary system. .
•	Dynamic: It involves the present status data for load adjusting. These are better calculations than static calculations.
•	Deterministic: These calculations utilize processor and cycle attributes to apportion cycles to the hubs.
•	Centralized: The framework states data is gathered by a single hub. 


 
Advantages of Load Balancing:
•	Load balancers minimize server response time and maximize throughput.
•	Load balancer ensures high availability and reliability by sending requests only to online servers
•	Load balancers do continuous health checks to monitor the server’s capability of handling the request.
Migration:
Another important policy to be used by a distributed operating system that supports process migration is to decide about the total number of times a process should be allowed to migrate. 
 
Migration  Models:
•	Code section
•	Resource section
•	Execution section 
•	Code section: It contains the real code. 
•	Resource fragment: It contains a reference to outer resources required by the interaction.
•	Execution section: It stores the ongoing execution condition of interaction, comprising private information, the stack, and the program counter.
•	Powerless movement: In the powerless relocation just the code section will be moved.
•	Solid relocation: In this movement, both the code fragment and the execution portion will be moved. The relocation additionally can be started by the source.
